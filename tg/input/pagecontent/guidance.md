### Guidance

#### TestScripts

##### Definition

The TestScript resources have been defined using the base FHIR R4 specification.

##### Execution

TestScript execution requires a FHIR conformant test engine. See [FHIR Testing]({{site.data.fhir.path}}testing.html)

##### Outstanding Issues

* **IG Publisher** - The HL7 FHIR IG Publisher tool does not currently produce a "testing" package
