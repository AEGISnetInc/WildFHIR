FHIR R4 Testing Guide

### Build Process

Builds are manually processed at this time.

#### TG Dependencies

The AEGIS WildFHIR Community Edition R4 TG depends on the AEGIS WildFHIR Community Edition R4 IG. Since both this TG and the dependent IG are not published as HL7 FHIR guides, prior to building this Testing Guide the Implementation Guide must be built in order to populate the local FHIR package cache.

#### Find the rendered TG available at

https://wildfhir.aegis.net/tg/wildfhirce/index.html

#### For the qa build log see

https://wildfhir.aegis.net/tg/wildfhirce/qa.html
